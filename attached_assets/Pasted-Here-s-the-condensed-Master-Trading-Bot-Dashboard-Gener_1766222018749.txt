Here's the condensed Master Trading Bot & Dashboard Generation Prompt:



🤖 Master Trading Bot & Dashboard Generation Prompt

Build a production-grade multi-grid crypto trading system integrating Bybit API v5 (REST + WebSocket), FastAPI + PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB + Redis, and TradingView Pine Script v5 for 34K USDT capital across BTC (95.5K-99K, 12 grids, 25K), MNT (1.04-1.12, 15 grids, 6K), DOGE (0.129-0.145, 18 grids), and PEPE (0.00000416-0.00000479, 24 grids, BTC filter critical). Implement: (1) Real-time OHLCV ingestion with sub-second latency, validation layer, and TimescaleDB storage with >99% uptime; (2) Multi-grid orchestration with yield waterfall logic (BTC profit >5% → TON deployment), inventory drift monitoring, and Friday harvest protocol; (3) TradingView zone-based alert engine with 4-layer automation (Config → Generate → Execute → Feedback), webhook integration to FastAPI /tv-alert, and <20% false positive rate; (4) Risk management with stop-loss triggers (BTC <94.8K, MNT <1.015, PEPE <0.00000395), kill switches (2+ volatility breakers, API errors >2%, equity <-30%), and regime detection for mode switching; (5) Feature engineering computing ATR-based risk metrics, EMA distances, volatility ratios, and VWAP deviations with <10s lag; (6) Streamlit/React dashboard displaying grid status, PnL tracking, alert classifications, and FastAPI control endpoints (/kill, /pause, /resume, /deploy, /rebalance). Generate production code with async patterns, exponential backoff, structured logging, type hints, health checks at every layer, HMAC authentication, parameterized SQL queries, and rate limiting (10 calls/sec). Deliverables: 10 Python modules (data_ingestion_service.py, grid_bot_controller.py, feature_computer.py, dashboard_api.py, alert_handler.py, risk_manager.py, database_schema.sql, docker-compose.yml, streamlit_dashboard.py, .env.example), Pine Script templates with exact zone parameters for all pairs, Google Apps Script config generator, and Grafana observability dashboard. Target metrics: 8-15 fills/day per bot, >85% profit capture rate, 80-120% APR, monthly profit >3-5%, and p99 API latency <500ms.
